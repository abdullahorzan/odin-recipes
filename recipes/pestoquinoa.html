    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a variation of our grain salad base recipe.
       Quinoa is a versatile grain; it’s as easy to make as rice, has great texture, and is full of fiber and protein. 
       This pesto quinoa salad is a great meal on its own or makes for a flavorful side!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quinona:</strong> any whole grain will work, but we don’t recommend using oats. Choose intact whole grains that keep their shape – brown rice, farro, wild rice, bulgur, or barley.</li>
        <li><strong>White Beans:</strong> use any variety of white bean – small navy, cannellini, or white kidney beans. Chickpeas or black eyed peas would also make acceptable substitutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Broccoli:</strong> substitute or add diced cucumber, carrots, red or orange bell pepper, zucchini, or summer squash.</li>
        <li><strong>Pesto:</strong> substitute sun-dried tomato pesto for a different flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan:</strong> substitute Grana Padano, Pecorino Romano, asiago, or aged cheddar. We think that cheese blocks taste best, but we recognize the convenience of pre-shredded cheese.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a fine-mesh strainer, rinse and drain quinoa. Place in a medium pot with water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the liquid is absorbed (~15 minutes). Look for a white ring that pops out when the quinoa is cooked. Remove from heat and let rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>While the quinoa is cooking, drain and rinse beans. If necessary, trim broccoli florets to make consistently sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Add the beans, broccoli, pesto and lemon juice to the bowl with the slightly cooled quinoa. Using a spatula, fold until well-combined. Top with parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>NOTES</b></p>

    <p>For extra flavor, toast the quinoa in the pot before adding the water.</p>
