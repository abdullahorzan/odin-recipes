    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a variation of our greek yogurt smoothie base recipe. 
       A coffee protein smoothie is a great way to start your morning, recover from a workout, or satisfy a craving for something cold, creamy, and sweet! 
       This coffee protein shake recipe is boosted with nut butter and flaxseeds to give you even more satisfying protein power!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Banana:</strong> substitute avocado for a similarly creamy texture and a boost of healthy fats </li>
        <li><strong>Greek Yogurt:</strong> substitute regular plain yogurt, kefir, or a dairy-free variety to make a vegan coffee protein smoothie.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> use cow’s milk or soy milk for a higher protein smoothie. Learn about plant-based milk vs cow’s milk in this article.</li>
        <li><strong>Nut Butter:</strong> use any natural variety. Make a coffee peanut butter protein smoothie, or use almond butter, sunflower butter, or whatever else sounds good to you! </li>
        <li><strong>Instant Coffee:</strong> substitute instant espresso powder or a shot of espresso. Feel free to substitute decaf instant coffee if you prefer a lower caffeine version.</li>
        <li><strong>Leafy Greens:</strong> use spinach or kale. If you are unsure about the flavor of greens in your smoothies, start with spinach. Spinach has a milder flavor than heartier greens like kale. Do not use arugula or mustard greens. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place all ingredients in a blender and puree. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>NOTES</b></p>

    <p>Be careful with the <b>leafy greens</b> you choose! Some can be very bitter. Spinach probably impacts the flavor the least. Kale and herbs are stronger. Hint: banana helps mask the flavor!</p>
